# Lox-Interpreter-Java
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Lox interpreter, based on the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. The project provides a working interpreter for the Lox programming language, implementing an interpreter for executing Lox code.

I developed this project while learning the concepts of building interpreters and programming languages, following along with the author's instructions and code. No additional features have been added to the original code, but it serves as a great reference for understanding how interpreters work.
